        <p class="first-body">
          Have an unidentified blemish on your skin that you're worried could be
          dangerous? Have limited access a dermatologist? Or maybe you're a
          doctor looking for a second opinion for their patient? Let DermaGraph
          be the solution to all these worries.

        <p class="first-body">
          <span class="bold">2 in 3 Australians </span>develop some form of
          malignant skin cancer over their lifetime, and worldwide this figure
          is 1 in 50. While the mortality rate for skin cancer is relatively
          low, its side effects significantly hinder your quality of life. By
          providing accessible, on-demand diagnosis for skin lesions, DermaGraph
          will make sure that you or your patient will not be a part of these
          statistics.

        <p class="first-body">
          How do we do this? DermaGraph utilises an industry-standard
          convolutional neural network (CNN) that uses a picture of your lesion,
          along with your demographics, to determine the likelihood of it being
          malignant with <span class="bold">91% accuracy.</span> Meanwhile,
          dermatologists only have an 86.6% accuracy with the naked eye. Thus,
          DermaGraph has several benefits:

              Studies show that when detected early, the 5-year survival rate
              for melanoma is 99%.

              DermaGraph operates solely through photographs, meaning you will
              not have to undergo an invasive biopsy.

              In most cases, the chance of malignancy is so low that you do not
              need to visit a dermatologist. While it is always better to do so,
              we acknowledge that there are many who have limited access to
              dermatologists.
